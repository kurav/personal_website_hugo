This project aims to compare 3 different types of segmentation: Boundary-based, Region-based and clustering. I've used tkinter to create a basic UI that lets the user decide on which segmentation to view.

**Boundary-based:**

In boundary based segmentation or edge-based segmentation, an edge filter is applied to the image, pixels are classified as edge or non-edge depending on the filter output, and pixels which are not separated by an edge are allocated to the same category.

**Region-based:**

In region-based segmentation algorithms operate iteratively by grouping together pixels which are neighbours and have similar values and splitting groups of pixels which are dissimilar in value.

**Clustering:**

In K-Means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised algorithm and it is used to segment the interest area from the background. It clusters, or partitions the given data into K-clusters or parts based on the K-centroids.
